# LFGHelper

A simple & lightweight **LFG/LFM** tool that makes it easier to find a group.
This tool will make the **LFG/LFM** spams much easier!
Now, you can do it by just writing **/lfg** before your message.

**LFG Helper** is a tool that continuously writes your **LFG/LFM** message in general and world chats so that you are free to continue questing or whatever you feel like doing.

  
  

## Settings: **(/lfg)**

  
  
Command | Description
-------------|----------
/lfg | Opens the GUI 
/lfg *your message* |Starts the addon with the message you've entered
/lfg stop | Stops the current addon
/lfg delay=SECONDS | Sets the delay between messages (Default 25 seconds)
/lfg help|Brings up the help menu

Example usage:

Command | Description
-------------|----------
| /lfg delay=10 |Sets delay to 10seconds between messages
| /lfg LFG BRD - MAGE 55 - SPELLCLEAVE | Starts the addon
| /lfg stop | Stops your current message.

  

### Notes:

In order to change the delay you will have to cancel your current message.

The addon will write in General, World, LookingForGroup and LFG channels. If you dont want to send your message in a certain channel, untick it in the GUI.
